#+title: Questions about Emacs Editor
#+author: Ayo Onipe

These are a set of questions about the emacs editor. These questions
may not be on the same level of abstraction, by that what I'm trying
to pass across is that they may not be about the same things. Some
questions may be about internal emacs mechanisms, and some might be
why certain things are done the way they are.

** Calling an interactive function with a 'message' vs. evaluating a 'message'

When you call an interactive function with a message, the function
returns its value and as a side-effect, the message is printed in the
echo area without double quotes.

When you evaluate a 'message', the message is printed out the echo
area with double quotes.

Aparrently, this is because the function returns its value. The value
of the message function is the string (the arg of the message
function) - an atom contained in quotes?
