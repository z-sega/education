What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots?
Explain.

The new-if is defined like:

(define (new-if predicate
		then-clause
		else-clause)
	(cond (predicate then-clause)
	      (else else-clause)))

The problem stems from the nature of `new-if` as a compound
procedure. It is not a _special form_ like the built-in `if`, which
only evaluates the <predicate>, and then depending on the outcome
decides whether to evaluate the <consequent> or the <alternative>.

For reference, the built-in `if` is structured like:

(if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)

This is the procedure that is affected:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
	(if (good-enough? guess x)
	    guess
	    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

The built in `if` will evaluate (good-enough? guess x), then, if #t,
`guess` is evaluate, and voila! However, the `new-if` evaluates
(good-enough? guess x), guess, and (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
x))). In the case of `new-if`, these are each formal parameters in the
`new-if` procedure definition.
